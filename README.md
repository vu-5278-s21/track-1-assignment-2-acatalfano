# Overview

This programming assignment will exercise your skills in creating Java
datastructures to best need the needs of the operations in an interface. 

It is OK if this assignment is difficult. Please put in your best effort.

The topics that you will cover in this assignment are:

  1. Java data structures
  2. Implementation of interfaces
  3. Use of the Composite Pattern
  
If you don't complete the assignment or your implementation has bugs, you
still need to turn in  your partial / broken implementation to receive
feedback. However, you should make sure that your work compiles. 

For those new to Java, completing the assignment will likely be an iterative
process. You do not need to panic if you can't complete the assignment 
prior to the second live session. There will be time to iterate on your
code and receive a good grade.

Tip: Commit and push to your repository frequently so that the instructor
can see your incremental work. Particularly for people that struggle 
with the assignment, lots of commits will show the effort that you put
in and raise your score. Also, 

## Running the Tests

The tests for the assignment are contained in the edu.vanderbilt.cs.live3.GeoHashDBTest
class. You can run this class as a JUnit test in your IDE or from the 
command line using "gradle test". Every time that you commit and push
to GitHub, GitHub Actions will compile and test your code. You can 
view the results on the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository.

## Grading 

If you don't complete the assignment or your implementation has bugs, you
still need to turn in  your partial / broken implementation to receive
feedback. However, you should make sure that your work compiles. 

Grading process:
   1. If you have a working implementation that passes all tests, you 
      will receive a 100
   2. If you have a broken / incomplete implementation, your grade will
      be based on the number of tests that your code passes and the
      overall code quality.
   3. You may receive a pull request with code comments specifying
      aspects of your solution that you need to improve.
   4. If you receive comments, you will need to address the comments
      and commit the updated version within a week of receiving the
      comments.
   5. You may receive multiple rounds of comments before receiving a
      grade.
  
What to do:
   1. See the edu.vanderbilt.cs.live3.GeoDB interface for instructions
   2. When your implementation is complete, make sure the most up
      to date version is committed and pushed to your assignment
      repository.
      
Warning! There may be typos, bugs, or other issues with the assignment.
If you encounter a bug, typo, etc., please post to the course discussion
forum to let the instructor know.
